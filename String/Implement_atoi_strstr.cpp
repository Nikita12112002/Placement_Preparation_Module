// What is the difference between stoi and atoi?
// First, atoi() converts C strings (null-terminated character arrays) to an integer,
// while stoi() converts the C++ string to an integer. 
//Second, the atoi() function will silently fail if the string is not convertible 
//to an int , while the stoi() function will simply throw an exception.
